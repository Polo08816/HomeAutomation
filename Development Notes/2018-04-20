Initial breadboard setup.  I did not realize the breadboard was actually two separate circuits.  It took a while to get the simple LED test to work.

First problem was that the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ was so new that GPIO.readall command gave an error.  I had to update the wiringpi model to 2.46 from 2.44.

The second problem was how to diagnose the LED problem.  
When running test.py, the simple LED did not light up.  
GPIO.readall showed that the values were registering programmatically.  
I used an actual voltmeter on the wedge which was attached to the breadboard.  
The board mode was correct.  
The output registered correctly on the voltmeter so I suspected the problem lie with the either the breadboard or the hardware.  
I moved one end of the resister to a closer position on the negative 3.3V rail and the LED worked.
