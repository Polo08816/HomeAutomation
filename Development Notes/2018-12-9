Setup of ZWay

1.  Download ZWay onto Raspberry Pi 3
2.  Plug in UZB1 (Usb zwave controller)
3.  Determine that it is in fact plugged in *lsusb
4.  It's either ttyACM0 or ttyAMA0.  Ours was ttyACM0.  Specify that in "Z Wave Network Access Page".
5.  Run script to change country code of the UZB1 to US due to different frequencies per country.
